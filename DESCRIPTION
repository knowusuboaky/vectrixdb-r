Description: A lightweight vector database for text retrieval in R with embedded
    machine learning models and no external API (Application Programming
    Interface) keys. Supports dense and hybrid search, optional HNSW
    (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) approximate nearest-neighbor indexing,
    faceted filters with ACL (Access Control List) metadata, command-line
    tools, and a local dashboard built with 'shiny'. The HNSW method is
    described by Malkov and Yashunin (2018) <doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2889473>.
